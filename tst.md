# [1]HTML : Learn the Basics

Welcome to the world of HTML! HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the backbone of every webpage you see on the internet. In this beginner-friendly guide, we'll walk you through the fundamentals of HTML, covering all the essential tags and elements you need to know to start building your own web pages.

## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a series of elements, each represented by a tag, which tells the browser how to display the content.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

Before diving into specific HTML tags, let's take a look at the basic structure of an HTML document:

htmlCopy code

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Your Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
    
    </body>
    </html> 

### Exercise 1:

Create an HTML document using the basic structure provided above. Save it as `index.html` and open it in a web browser to see a blank webpage.

## Essential HTML Tags:

### 1. `<html>`

The `<html>` tag represents the root of an HTML document.

### 2. `<head>`

The `<head>` tag contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, and viewport settings.

### 3. `<title>`

The `<title>` tag sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

### 4. `<body>`

The `<body>` tag contains the main content of the webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements.

### 5. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`

These tags are used to define headings of different levels, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` being the lowest.


    <h1>This is a Heading Level 1</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading Level 2</h2>

### Exercise 2:

Create a webpage with a title, a main heading, and a subheading using the `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags.

### 6. `<p>`

The `<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs of text.

htmlCopy code

`<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>` 

### 7. `<a>`

The `<a>` tag creates hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.

htmlCopy code

`<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>` 

### 8. `<img>`

The `<img>` tag embeds images into the webpage.

htmlCopy code

`<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">` 

### Exercise 3:

Add an image to your webpage using the `<img>` tag. Save the image file in the same directory as your HTML document.
